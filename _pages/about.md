I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan where I study Data Science and Chemical Engineering. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and the physical sciences.

I'm a research assistant in the lab of [Dr. Fei Wen](http://cheresearch.engin.umich.edu/wen/){:target="\_blank"}, where I develop domain-informed, interpretable ML tools for immunology. I also represented my university in [ProjectX](https://www.projectx2020.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an international research competition on ML for climate change solutions.
