I'm a rising 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan where I study Data Science and Chemical Engineering. My interests span machine learning, computer vision, statistics, and the physical sciences. I'm currently a research intern working on deep learning for fluid physics at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="\_blank"}

Recently, my research has focused on [super-resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbwTb7DNe0vRZiN9hg53W5MZdRbXJqsg/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} for climate and fluid dynamics. I represented my university in [ProjectX](https://www.projectx2020.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an international research competition on ML for climate change solutions. Before this, I worked on semantic segmentation for defect detection in semiconductor fabrication. I've also done research in computational immunology and anomaly detection.
