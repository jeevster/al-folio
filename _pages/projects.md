<font size="+1"> <b> Spatial and Temporal Super-Resolution of Global Climate Models using Deep Learning </b></font>
Physics-based global climate simulations are computationally expensive and limited to low spatial and temporal resolutions, making it difficult to predict and track highly localized extreme weather phenomena. We used deep learning (SRGAN, CycleGAN, Super Slo Mo, and other methods) to increase the resolution of global climate models in both space and time. Full text coming soon!

<font size="+1"> <b> Deep Semantic Segmentation of Silicon Carbide Wafer Scratches </b> </font>
I designed a deep segmentation pipeline in TensorFlow for scratch detection on silicon carbide wafers. At the heart of the pipeline is a fully convolutional network inspired by UNet, ResNet, and Inception architectures. Along the way, I curated a benchmark dataset of ground truth wafer segmentation maps pooled from multiple chemical engineers and domain experts.

<font size="+1"> <b>Machine Learning for Immune Cell Profiling</b> </font>
Time-of-flight mass cytometry - [CyTOF](https://www.fluidigm.com/products/helios){:target="\_blank"}- enables high-throughput, deep phenotyping of immune cells at the single-cell level. I work on ML techniques like clustering (GMM, hierarchical), dimensionality reduction (tSNE, PCA), and supervised deep learning (CNN, graph networks) to analyze immunological datasets. Manuscripts currently under review.

<font size="+1"> <b>Multi-stage Fault Warning for Large Electric Grids using Anomaly Detection and Machine Learning</b> </font>
In this work, we proposed a multi-stage early warning system for electric grid fault detection, classification, subgroup discovery, and visualization. We leveraged both supervised and unsupervised ML methods as well as dimensionality reduction.

<font size="+1"> <b>Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis of Homicides and Shootings in Rochester, NY </b></font>
We used gaussian mixture models, regression, and hypothesis testing to analyze historical crime data from Rochester, NY. For this work, we won 1st place in the 2018 Monroe County High School Data Analysis Competition.
